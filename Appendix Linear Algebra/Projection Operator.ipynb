    "A projection is a linear transformation $P$ from a vector space to itself (an endomorphism) such that $P\\circ P=P$. Whenever the projection operator $P$ is applied twice to any vector, it gives the same result as if it were applied once, in other words, the projection operator $P$ is idempotent."
