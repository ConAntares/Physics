    "* Theory by Paul Drude in 1900, three years after the electron was discovered.\n",
    "* Drude treated the free electrons as a classical ideal gas but the electrons collide with the stationary ions, not with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory assumes that there is no interaction with each electron, independent electron approximation interaction between electrons and core instantaneous and short-range:\n",

    "We start from the kinetic theory of gases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{2}m⟨v_t⟩^2 = \\frac{3}{2}k_BT $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant, and $T$ the absolute temperature defined by the ideal gas law. Then, we can get the molecular average velocity:\n",
