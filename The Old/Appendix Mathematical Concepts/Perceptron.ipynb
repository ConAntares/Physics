    "A NAND gate (NOT-AND) is a logic gate which produces an output which is false only if all its inputs are true; thus its output is complement to that of an AND gate.

By De Morgan's laws, a two-input NAND gate's logic may be expressed as $A\\cdot B = A + B$, making a NAND gate equivalent to inverters followed by an OR gate. \n",

    "XOR gate (sometimes EOR, or EXOR and pronounced as Exclusive OR) is a digital logic gate that gives a true ($1$) output when the number of true inputs is odd. An XOR gate implements an exclusive or $\\nleftrightarrow$ from mathematical logic; that is, a true output results if one, and only one, of the inputs to the gate is true. If both inputs are false ($0$) or both are true, a false output results. XOR represents the inequality function, i.e., the output is true if the inputs are not alike otherwise the output is false. A way to remember XOR is \"must have one or the other but not both\".\n",
