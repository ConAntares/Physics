    "Representing an n-dimensional vector requests to offer an n-dimensional vector space $\\mathbb{V}^n$. The vector is written as an n-tuple of numbers. For n-dimensional real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n = \\{(r_1, r_2, ... , r_n): r_1, r_2, ... , r_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\}$, the vector can be represented as $\\vec{r} = (r_1, r_2, ... , r_n) $\n",

    "For example, the vector $\\vec{r} = (x, y, z)$ is a 3-dimensional vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The zero vector is in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with all elements zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can be divided into row vectors and column vectors. The transpose of a column vector is a row vector with the same length and elements order, and vice versa. The transpose of vector $v$ is represented as $v^T$, the conjugate of this vector is represented as $v^*$, and the Hermitian transpose (conjugate transpose) is represented as $v^\\dag$. With Dirac notation, we can represent a row vector as a Bra: $|r⟩$, and a column vector as a Ket: $⟨c|$.\n",
