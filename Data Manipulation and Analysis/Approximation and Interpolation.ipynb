    "### Taylor approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taylor approximation is an application of the Taylor series. It is a mathematical method used to approximate functions that are smooth and differentiable in a neighborhood of a given point. It is named after the English mathematician Brook Taylor, who introduced the concept in the early 18th century. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Taylor approximation expresses a function as an infinite sum of terms, with each term being a multiple of the function's derivatives at a specific point. The general formula for the Taylor series of a function $f(x)$ around a point $\\mathrm a$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "f(x)&=f(a)+\\frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a)+\\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2+\\frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3+\\cdots+\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n+\\cdots \\\\ \n",
    "&=\\sum_{i=0} \\frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i \\\\\n",
    "&=f(a)+\\nabla f(a)^T(x-a)\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor approximation involves using a Taylor series to approximate a function in a neighborhood of a specific point. By taking a finite number of terms from the Taylor series, you can create a Taylor polynomial that serves as an approximation of the original function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of terms used in the Taylor polynomial. The more terms included, the better the approximation becomes. However, it may also become more computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fourier approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier approximation is a powerful tool in mathematics, widely used in physics, engineering, and data analysis. The fundamental idea is to represent any periodic function as an infinite series of simple sine and cosine functions, where the frequencies of these functions are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of the Fourier series is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} [a_n \\cos(nx) + b_n \\sin(nx)] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_n$ and $b_n$ are the Fourier coefficients, which can be calculated by the following integrals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "a_n &= \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} f(x) \\cos(n \\frac{2\\pi x}{T}) {\\rm d}x \\\\\n",
    "b_n &= \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} f(x) \\sin(n \\frac{2\\pi x}{T}) {\\rm d}x \n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given function $f(x)$, as long as it meets certain conditions, we can find its Fourier series by calculating the Fourier coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$, and then use the Fourier series to approximate this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lagrange Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrange interpolation is a common method of interpolation. The basic idea is to find a polynomial that equals the given values at a set of discrete points. The form of the Lagrange interpolation polynomial is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n y_i l_i(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $l_i(x)$ is the Lagrange basis function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L_i(x) = \\prod_{j=0, j\\neq i}^n \\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton's Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's interpolation is another common method of interpolation. The basic idea is to find a polynomial that equals the given values at a set of discrete points. The form of the Newton interpolation polynomial is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(x) = f[x_0] + f[x_0, x_1](x-x_0) + f[x_0, x_1, x_2](x-x_0)(x-x_1) + \\ldots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cubic Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "If the values of a function $f(x)$ and its derivate are known at $x=0$ and $x=1$, then, the function can be interpolated on the interval $[0,1]$ using a third-degree polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third-degree polynomial and its derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f(x) &= ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n",
    "f'(x) &= 3ax^2 + 2bx + c\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the polynomial and its derivative at $x=0$ and $x=1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f(0) &= d\n",
    "f(1) &= a + b + c + d\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f'(0) &= c\n",
    "f'(1) &= 3a + 2b + c\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The four equations above can be rewritten to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "a &= 2f(0) - 2f(1) + f'(0) + f'(1)\n",
    "b &= -3f(0) + 3f(1) - 2f'(0) - f'(1)\n",
    "c &= f'(0)\n",
    "d &= f(0)\n",
