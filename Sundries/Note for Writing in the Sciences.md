## Introduction, principles of effective writing

### 1.1 Introduction

+ What makes good writing?
  + Good writing communicates an idea clearly and effectively;
  + Good writing is elegant and stylish

Claring writing just takes having something to say and clear thinking.

Don't want you to even worry about elegant and stylish when you're writing your first draft, just worry about getting that idea across in a clear and logical and efficient way.

Elegant and stylish writing happens in revision, not on the first draft, even for professional writers. Just barrel through that first draft and then spend time revising.

+ What makes a good writer?
  + Having something to say;
  + Logical thinking;
  + A few simple, learnable rules of style;

+ Become a better writer
  + Read, pay attention, and imitate;
  + Write in a journey;
  + Let go of 'academic' writing habits (deprogramming step);
  + Talk about your research before trying to write about it;
  + Write to engage your reader: try not to bore them!
  + Stop waiting for 'inspiration';
  + Accept that writing is hard for everyone, even professional writers;
  + Revise. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try;
  + Learn how to cut ruthlessly, never become too attached to your words;
  + Find a good editor;
  + Take risks.

### 1.2 Examples of what not to do

+ Ask yourself
  + Is this sentence esay to understand?
  + Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
  + Is this sentence readable?
  + Is it written to inform or to obscure?

Really the scientific literature should be enjoyable and interesting to read. The point of scientific writing is to inform.

+ The verbs drives sentences whereas nouns slow them down.

+ Themes of this course
  + Complex ideas do not require complex language;
  + Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read.

### 1.3 Overview, principles of effective writing

+ Avoid the use of acronyms, other than those that are completely standard that most people will know.

+ Do not put too much distance between the subject of the sectence and the main verb.

+ Overview: Principles of effective writing
  + Cut unnecessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words;
  + Use the active voice (subject + verb + object);
  + Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb;

### 1.4 Cut the clutter

> The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - these are thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to the education and rank. William Zinsser, On Writing Well.

+ Be vigilant and ruthless

+ After investing much effort to put words on a page, we often find it hard to part with them.

+ Try the sentence without the extra words and see how it's better - conveys the same idea with more power.

+ Avoid list
  + Dead weight words and phrases
    + As it is well known
    + As it has been shown
    + It can be regarded that
    + It should be emphasized that
  + Empty words and phrases
    + basic tenets of
    + methodologic
    + important
  + Long words or phrases that could be short
  + Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
  + Repetitive words or phases
    + Studies / examples
    + illustrate / demonstrate
    + challenges / difficulties
    + successful / solutions
  + Adverbs
    + very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc.

+ Long words and phrases that could be short
  + a majority of             → most
  + a number of               → many
  + are of the same opinion   → agree
  + less frequently occurring → rare
  + all three of the          → the three
  + give rise to              → cause
  + due to the fact that      → because
  + Have an effect on         → affect
  + The result of                     → due to
  + In many instances                 → often

> Some words and phrases are blobs. William Zinsser, On Writing Well.

> I have only made this letter rather long because I have not had time to make it shorter. Blaise Pascal, Lettres Provinciales, 16, Dec.14, 1656.

### 1.5 Cut the clutter, more tricks

+ A few other small tricks
  + Eliminate negatives
  + Eliminate superfluous uses of 'there are / there is'
  + Omit needless prepositions

+ Use an exciting verb rather than a to be werb.

### 1.6 Practicing cutting cluter

+ The best way to learn writing is through practice.

Examples:

Before
> Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease.  

After
> Anti-inflammatory drugs protect against Alzheimer’s Disease.

Before
> Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.  

After
> Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of newborns.

Before
> Ultimately p53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays a role in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility.  

After
> Besides preventing cancer, p53 also works in aging, differentiation, and fertility.

Before
> Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically.  

After
> Injuries to the brain and spinal cord are among the most devastating and expensive.

Before
> An IQ test measures an individual’s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of verbal communication, reasoning, and performance on tasks that represent motor and spatial capabilities.  

After
> An IQ test measures an individual's verbal, reasoning, or motor and spatial abilities.

Before
> As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 Up, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy.  

After
> Figure 2 shows that a return kinetic energy less than 2.3 U_p yields two electron trajectories.

## Writing with Strong

### 2.1 Use the active voice

Use strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, keep the subject and main verb close together at the beginning.

+ Active voice
  + Subject → verb → object.

+ Passive voice
  + A form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb;
  + The main verb must be transitive verb;
  + Passive voice usually takes out the responsible party.

+ To turn the passive voice back to the active voice
  + Who does what to whom? - The agent.

+ Advantages of the active voice
  + Emphasizes author responsibility;
  + Improves readability;
  + Reduces ambiguity.

+ Is it ever OK to use the passive voice?
  + Yes! The passive voice exists in the English language for a reason. Just use it sparingly and purposefully. For example, passive voice may be appropriate in the methods section where what was done is more important than who did it.

### 2.2 Is it really OK to use 'We' and 'I'

+ It's okay to use personal pronouns.
  + The active voice is livelier and easier to read;
  + Avoiding personal pronous does not make your science more objective;
  + By agreeing to be an author on the paper, you are taking responsibility for its content. 
    Thus, you should also claim responsibility for assertions in the text by using personal pronouns;
  + Journals want this.

An example of an opening sentence in a paper:

> We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.). This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest. April 25, 1953 (2), Nature (3) , 171, 737-738.

### 2.3 Active voice practice

+ Text of practice exercises for Module 2.3:

Before
> A recommendation was made by the DSMB committee that the study be halted.

After
> The DSMB committee recommended that the study be halted.

Before
> Major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects were found.

After
> We observed major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects.

Or
> The two study subjects differed in reaction times.

Before
> It was concluded by the editors that the data had been falsified by the authors.

After
> The editors concluded that the authors falsified their data.

Before
> The first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.

After
> NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has taken the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star.

Before
> Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are not different was rejected.

After
> Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are comparable.

If there is no agent, we can assume it's the authors of that article.

### 2.4 Write with verbs

+ Three principles
  + Use strong verbs
  + Avoid turning verbs into nouns
  + Do not bury the main verb

+ Use strong verbs
  + Verbs makes sentences go;
  + Pick the right verb, avoid the use of adverbs;
  + Use "to be" verbs purposefully and sparingly: they are overused and boring,

+ Avoid turning verbs into nouns
  + Examples
    + Obtain estimates of               → estimate
    + Has seen an expansion in          → has expanded
    + Provides a methodologic emphasis  → emphasizes methodology
    + Take an assessment of             → assess
    + Provide a review of               → review
    + Offer confirmation of             → confirm
    + Make a decision                   → decide
    + Shows a peak                      → peaks
    + Provide a description of          → describe

+ Do not bury the main verb
  + Keep the subject and main verb: (Predicate) close together at the start of the sentence.
    + Readers are waiting for the verb.

### 2.5 Practice examples

Before
> The fear expressed by some teachers that students would not learn statistics well if they were permitted to use canned computer programs has not been realized in our experience. A careful monitoring of achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students’ performances.

After
> Many teachers feared that the use of canned computer programs would prevents students from learning statistics. We monitored student achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in our course and found detriments in performance.

Before
> Review of each center’s progress in recruitment is important to ensure that the cost involved in maintaining each center’s participation is worthwhile.

After
> We should review each center's recruitment progress to make sure its continued participation is cost-effective.

Before
> It should be emphasized that these proportions generally are not the result of significant increases in moderate and severe injuries, but in many instances reflect mildly injured persons not being seen at a hospital.

After
> Shifting proportions in injury severity may reflect stricter hospital admission criteria rather than true increases in moderate and severe injuries.

Before
> Important studies to examine the descriptive epidemiology of autism, including the prevalence and changes in the characteristics of the population over time, have begun.

After
>
