# Note for Writing in the Sciences

This is my personal study note for the 'Writing in the Science' course, which is provided through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite).

## Introduction, principles of effective writing

### 1.1 Introduction

+ What makes good writing?
  + Good writing communicates an idea clearly and effectively;
  + Good writing is elegant and stylish

Claring writing just takes having something to say and clear thinking.

Don't want you to even worry about elegant and stylish when you're writing your first draft, just worry about getting that idea across in a clear and logical and efficient way.

Elegant and stylish writing happens in revision, not on the first draft, even for professional writers. Just barrel through that first draft and then spend time revising.

+ What makes a good writer?
  + Having something to say;
  + Logical thinking;
  + A few simple, learnable rules of style;

+ Become a better writer

  + Stop waiting for 'inspiration';
  + Accept that writing is hard for everyone, even professional writers;
  + Revise. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try;
  + Learn how to cut ruthlessly, never become too attached to your words;
  + Find a good editor;
  + Take risks.

### 1.2 Examples of what not to do

+ Ask yourself
  + Is this sentence esay to understand?
  + Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
  + Is this sentence readable?
  + Is it written to inform or to obscure?

Really the scientific literature should be enjoyable and interesting to read. The point of scientific writing is to inform.

+ The verbs drives sentences whereas nouns slow them down.

+ Themes of this course
  + Complex ideas do not require complex language;
  + Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read.

### 1.3 Overview, principles of effective writing

+ Avoid the use of acronyms, other than those that are completely standard that most people will know.

+ Do not put too much distance between the subject of the sectence and the main verb.

+ Overview: Principles of effective writing
  + Cut unnecessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words;
  + Use the active voice (subject + verb + object);
  + Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb;

### 1.4 Cut the clutter

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - these are thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to the education and rank. by William Zinsser, On writing well.
