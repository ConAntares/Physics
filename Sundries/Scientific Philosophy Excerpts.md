# Scientific Philosophy Excerpts

## Nature Science

* Modern science, then, has been heir to two different traditions, and, when discussing its evolution, we shall have to bear both in mind. On the one hand that set of ancient beliefs and practices to which, for better or worse, the name of Aristotle is usually attached; on the other, the quite different practices which during the same centuries were developing among the artisans, the craftsmen, and the experimenters in the world of everyday affairs, and whose effects began to penetrate, first into practical mathematics and astronomy, and later into physics, chemistry, and the other ‘sciences of nature.’ (Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 1962)

* It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong! (Richard Feynman, Cornell University, 1964)

* Many students enter physics with the impression that it is just a lot of mathematical calculations. Calculations are a part of physics, but they are not the most important part. The most important part of physics is the part that deals with phenomena. Most of physics comes from phenomena. Phenomena are the roots of physics. (Robert R. Wilson, Experiments and the Future of Physics, 1978)

* Quantum phenomena do not occur in a Hilbert space. They occur in a laboratory. (Asher Peres, Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods, 1993)

* It is said that mathematics is the language of Nature. If so, then physics is its poetry. (Sadri Hassani, Mathematical Physics, 2002)

* Anybody who wants to do good physics, should be constantly paying attention to physical phenomena, and not the symbols that stand for physical objects. (R.Shankar, Yale Opencourse on Fundamentals of Physics, 2010)

* We have faith that the underlying laws of nature will have a certain elegance and a certain beauty, and a certain uniformity across all of natural phenomena. That is a faith that we have. It is not a religious issue. (R.Shankar, Yale Opencourse on Fundamentals of Physics, 2010)

* To Einstein, it was very obvious that nature would not design a system, in which mechanical laws are the same, but laws of electricity are different. (R.Shankar, Yale Opencourse on Fundamentals of Physics, 2010)

* Every calculation ever done by physicist is approximate. (R.Shankar, Yale Opencourse on Fundamentals of Physics, 2010)

* One thing we demand of every new theory is that part of coincides with the old theory. If you go back to the old experiments which are explained by the old theory, well your new theory should continue to explain that. In fact the new theory, when it is a good one, will tell you why for hundreds of years people feel for the old theory and then it will also do new stuff.

## Mathematics

* Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things. (Henri Poincaré, Science and Hypothesis, 1902)

## Social Science

* I believe that democracy is the best guarantor for peace and for the ultimate peaceful resolution of differences. I believe that it is far better to have a system of government in which dissent is permitted than to have one in which all the apparatus of the state is brought to bear to enforce conformity. I believe that even the worst democracy is better than the best dictatorship, and that the only solution to the problems of the Middle East is to encourage the evolution of democratic institutions. (Al Gore, Earth in the Balance, 1992)

* believe that people with mental illness and intellectual disability do not deserve the right to survive. Once such a standard exists, someday anyone could fall under it. - (X.Luo, CUPL)
