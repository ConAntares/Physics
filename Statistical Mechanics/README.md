# Statistical Mechanics

## About

This repository includes classical and quantum statistical mechanics. Deservedly, we also introduce Thermodynamics.

Thermodynamics deals with heat and temperature, and their relation to energy, work, radiation, and properties of matter. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics.
