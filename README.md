## About this repository

My notes on Computational Physics including both classical physics and quantum physics.  
Python3.x is the demonstrated language in Jupyter Notebook, however, the algorithms are universal.  
This is a long-term plan.

## How to use

Please [clone this repository](https://github.com/Photonico/Computational_Physics.git) to your computer, and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter Kernel](https://jupyter.org/), If you want the better studying experience, after the above steps, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extension [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
