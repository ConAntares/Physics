## About this repository

My notes on Algorithms and Computational Physics, Python 3.10 is the major demonstrated programming language.

This is a long-term plan.

## How to use

I strongly suggest cloning [this repository](https://github.com/ConAntares/Algorithms.git) to your computer and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extension [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), extension [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), and extension [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one). Other Jupyter Editors are also recommended.
